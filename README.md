# random-python-trash

i get bored pretty easily on weekends specially when is pouring rain outside and sometimes stuff like this comes out, i haven't messed with anything python or pygame related in a big while to focus on c# and .NET development for job hiring reasons lmao, so this was a fun little way to try to finish configuring my neovim editor and see if i still got it at my first programming language (sadly i dont) i will be adding more stuff here when i fell like it though

the first project is me raw dogging flappy bird with no sprites sound nor will to live
the second is just me triyng to recreate a guy who does simulations like that on tiktok
